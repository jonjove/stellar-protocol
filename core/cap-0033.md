CAP: 0033
Title: Sponsored Reserve with EphemeralSponsorshipEntry
Author: Jonathan Jove
Status: Draft

Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
This proposal makes it possible to pay reserves for another account.

## Motivation
This proposal seeks to solve the following problem: an entity should be able to
provide the reserve for accounts controlled by other parties without giving
those parties control of the reserve.

Consider, for example, an issuer that is willing to pay the reserve for trust
lines to the asset it issues. With the current version of the protocol, the
reserve must be part of the balance of an account. This means the issuer can
only pay the reserve by sending native asset to accounts that create a trust
line to the asset it issues. But this leaves the issuer vulnerable to attack
because an attacker can extract funds from the issuer by creating new accounts,
creating the trust line, waiting for the native asset to arrive, then removing
the trust line and merging the account.

This proposal is in many ways analogous to CAP-0015:

- CAP-0015 makes it possible to pay transaction fees for other accounts without
giving control of the underlying funds
- CAP-0033 makes it possible to pay reserves for other accounts without giving
control of the underlying funds

The combination of these two proposals should greatly facilitate the development
of non-custodial uses of the Stellar Network.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goal:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products.

## Abstract
We introduce ephemeral ledger entries as a new conceptual category of ledger
entry, with the defining property that ephemeral ledger entries never persist in
the bucket list. `EphemeralSponsorshipEntry` is the first ephemeral ledger
entry, representing the relationship "is sponsoring future reserves for". An
`EphemeralSponsorshipEntry` can be created, modified or deleted only by the
`ManageSponsorshipOp`. Sponsored reserves can be reclaimed under some conditions
by `RevokeSponsorshipOp`. We also introduce extensions to `AccountEntry` and
`LedgerEntry` which record pertinent information about sponsorships.

## Specification
This specification assumes CAP-0023, in order to show how sponsorships would
work for claimable balance entries.

### XDR

#### AccountEntry
```c++
struct SponsorshipDescriptor
{
    AccountID sponsoringID;
    uint32 reserve;
};

typedef SponsorshipDescriptor* SignerSponsorship;

struct AccountEntryExtensionV2
{
    uint32 numSponsored;
    SignerSponsorship signerSponsorships<20>;
};

struct AccountEntryExtensionV1
{
    Liabilities liabilities;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 2:
        AccountEntryExtensionV2 v2;
    }
    ext;
};

struct AccountEntry
{
    // ... unchanged ...

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        AccountEntryExtensionV1 v1;
    }
    ext;
};
```

#### ClaimableBalanceEntry
Note that `ClaimableBalanceEntry` is not in the current protocol, so the XDR can
still be modified.

```c++
struct ClaimableBalanceEntry
{
    // Unique identifier for this ClaimableBalanceEntry
    ClaimableBalanceID balanceID;

    // List of claimants with associated predicate
    Claimant claimants<10>;

    // Any asset including native
    Asset asset;

    // Amount of asset
    int64 amount;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
```

#### EphemeralSponsorshipEntry
```c++
struct EphemeralSponsorshipEntry
{
    AccountID sponsoredID;
    AccountID sponsoringID;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
```

#### LedgerEntry, GeneralizedLedgerEntry, and GeneralizedLedgerKey

{
    ACCOUNT = 0,
    TRUSTLINE = 1,
    OFFER = 2,
    DATA = 3,
    CLAIMABLE_BALANCE = 4,
    EPHEMERAL_SPONSORSHIP = 5
};

struct LedgerEntryExtensionV1
{
    SponsorshipDescriptor sponsorship;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }

};

struct LedgerEntry
{
    // ... unchanged ...

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        LedgerEntryExtensionV1 v1;
    }
    ext;
};

struct GeneralizedLedgerEntry
{
    uint32 lastModifiedLedgerSeq; // ledger the LedgerEntry was last changed

    union switch (LedgerEntryType type)
    {
    case ACCOUNT:
        AccountEntry account;
    case TRUSTLINE:
        TrustLineEntry trustLine;

    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        LedgerEntryExtensionV1 v1;
    }
    ext;
};

        AccountID accountID;
    } account;

case TRUSTLINE:
    struct
    {
        AccountID accountID;
        Asset asset;
    } trustLine;

case OFFER:

        AccountID sellerID;
        int64 offerID;

        AccountID accountID;
        string64 dataName;
    } data;

case CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:

    {
        ClaimableBalanceID balanceID;
    } claimableBalance;

case EPHEMERAL_SPONSORSHIP:

        AccountID sponsoredID;
    } sponsorship;
};
```

#### Operations
```c++
enum OperationType
{
    // ... CREATE_ACCOUNT, ..., MANAGE_BUY_OFFER unchanged ...
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND = 13,
    MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP = 14,
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP = 15
};

struct ManageSponsorshipOp
{
    AccountID sponsoredID;
};

enum RevokeSponsorshipType
{
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY = 0,
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_SIGNER = 1
};

union RevokeSponsorshipOp switch (RevokeSponsorshipType type)
{
case REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY:
    LedgerKey ledgerKey;
case REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_SIGNER:
    struct
    {
        AccountID accountID;
        SignerKey signerKey;
    }
    signer;
};

struct Operation
{
    // sourceAccount is the account used to run the operation
    // if not set, the runtime defaults to "sourceAccount" specified at
    // the transaction level
    MuxedAccount* sourceAccount;

    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACCOUNT, ..., PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND unchanged ...
    case MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP:
        ManageSponsorshipOp manageSponsorshipOp;
    case REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP:
        RevokeSponsorshipOp revokeSponsorshipOp;
    }
    body;
};
```

#### Operation Results
```c++
enum ManageSponsorshipResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS = 0
};

union ManageSponsorshipResult switch (ManageSponsorshipResultCode code)
{
case MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS:
    void;
};

enum RevokeSponsorshipResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS = 0,

    // codes considered as "failure" for the operation
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST = -1,
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR = -2,
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_UNDERFUNDED = -3,
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LINE_FULL = -4
};

union OperationResult switch (OperationResultCode code)
{
case opINNER:
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACCOUNT, ..., PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND unchanged ...
    case MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP:
        ManageSponsorshipResult manageSponsorshipResult;
    case REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP:
        RevokeSponsorshipResult revokeSponsorshipResult;
    }
    tr;
default:
    void;
};
```

#### Transaction Results
```c++
enum TransactionResultCode
{
    // ... txFEE_BUMP_INNER_SUCCESS, ..., txNOT_SUPPORTED unchanged ...
    txFEE_BUMP_INNER_FAILED = -13, // fee bump inner transaction failed
    txRESIDUAL_EPHEMERAL_ENTRY = -14 // ephemeral ledger entry not removed
};

struct InnerTransactionResult
{
    // Always 0. Here for binary compatibility.
    int64 feeCharged;

    union switch (TransactionResultCode code)
    {
    // ... txFEE_BUMP_INNER_SUCCESS, ..., txFEE_BUMP_INNER_FAILED unchanged ...
    case txRESIDUAL_EPHEMERAL_ENTRY:
        void;
    }
    result;

    // ext unchanged
};
```

### Semantics

#### Reserve Requirement
No operation can take the native balance of an account below
`(2 + numSubEntries - numSponsored) * baseReserve + liabilities.selling`.

#### Ephemeral Ledger Entries
An ephemeral ledger entry is any ledger entry that must be removed in order for
a transaction to succeed. Specifically, this means that an ephemeral ledger
entry never persists in the bucket list. It follows that the XDR for ephemeral
ledger entries is not technically part of the protocol, because ephemeral ledger
entries are characterized by absence.

If an ephemeral ledger entry exists upon completion of a transaction, then the
transaction fails with the result `txRESIDUAL_EPHEMERAL_ENTRY`.

#### Sponsoring Future Reserves
An account `A` is sponsoring future reserves for an account `B` if there exists
an `EphemeralSponsorshipEntry s` with `s.sponsoringID = A` and
`s.sponsoredID = B`. When `A` is sponsoring future reserves for `B`, balance
will be deducted from `A` and "stored" in any ledger entry/sub-entry for which
`B` would need to provide reserve. Sponsoring account creation (if `B` does not
yet exist) would deduct `2 * baseReserve` whereas sponsoring any other sub-entry
would deduct just `baseReserve`. If `A` does not have sufficient available
balance of native asset, then the operation fails.

#### Removing a Sponsored Ledger Entry or Sub-Entry
When a sponsored ledger entry or sub-entry is removed, the `reserve` is returned
to the sponsoring account as specified in `sponsoringID`. It is possible that
the sponsoring account does not exist or does not have sufficient available
limit to receive the `reserve`, in which case the `reserve` will be sent to the
fee pool. If this happens, then the `reserve` is lost forever.

#### ManageSponsorshipOp
`ManageSponsorshipOp` is the only operation that can create, modify, or delete
an `EphemeralSponsorshipEntry`. `ManageSponsorshipOp` cannot be invald.

The behavior of `ManageSponsorshipOp op` is as follows:
```
Load EphemeralSponsorshipEntry s with s.sponsoredID = op.sponsoredID
If s exists
    If op.sponsoredID == op.sourceAccount
        Delete s
    Else
        Set s.sponsoringID = op.sourceAccount
Else
    If op.sponsoredID != op.sourceAccount
        Create EphemeralSponsorshipEntry s with s.sponsoredID = op.sponsoredID
                                            and s.sponsoringID = op.sourceAccount
Succeed with MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS
```

`ManageSponsorshipOp` requires medium threshold.

#### RevokeSponsorshipOp
Whereas `ManageSponsorshipOp` is used to control whether accounts are sponsoring
future reserves, `RevokeSponsorshipOp` allows the sponsor of existing reserves
to recover funds when the sponsored account can afford the reserve itself.
`RevokeSponsorshipOp op` is invalid if
`op.type() == REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY` and
`op.ledgerKey().type() == CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.

The behavior of `RevokeSponsorshipOp op` is as follows:
```
If op.type() == REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY
    Load LedgerEntry le with key = op.ledgerKey()
    If le does not exist
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST
    If le.ext.v() != 1 OR le.ext.v1().sponsorship.sponsoringID != op.sourceAccount
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR

    Load AccountEntry acc with acc.accountID = Account(le)
    requiredReserve = baseReserve
    If op.ledgerKey().type() == ACCOUNT
        requiredReserve = 2 * baseReserve
    If AvailableBalance(source, NATIVE) < requiredReserve
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_UNDERFUNDED
    acc.numSponsored--

    Load AccountEntry source with source.accountID = op.sourceAccount
    If AvailableLimit(source, NATIVE) < le.ext.v1().sponsorship.reserve
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LINE_FULL
    source.balance += le.ext.v1().sponsorship.reserve
    Set le.ext.v(0)
Else if op.type() == REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_SIGNER
    Load AccountEntry acc with acc.accountID = op.signer().accountID
    If acc does not exist OR acc.ext.v() != 2
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST
    If op.signer().signerKey not in acc.signers
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST

    Let i be such that acc.signers[i].signerKey = op.signer().signerKey
    If acc.ext.v2().signerSponsorships[i] != op.sourceAccount
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR

    If AvailableBalance(source, NATIVE) < baseReserve
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_UNDERFUNDED
    acc.numSponsored--

    Load AccountEntry source with source.accountID = op.sourceAccount
    If AvailableLimit(source, NATIVE) < acc.ext.v2().signerSponsorships[i].reserve
        Fail with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_LINE_FULL
    source.balance += acc.ext.v2().signerSponsorships[i].reserve
    Clear acc.ext.v2().signerSponsorships[i]

Succeed with REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS
```

`RevokeSponsorshipOp` requires medium threshold.

#### ClaimableBalanceEntry
`ClaimableBalanceEntry` has semantics equivalent to what is described in
CAP-0023, except that `createdBy` and `reserve` are everywhere replaced by
`sponsoringID` and `reserve` in the `LedgerEntry` extension.

#### Other Operations
Other operations will need updated semantics in order to behave correctly with
this proposal. This section will be expanded once there is a moderate consensus
on this approach.

## Design Rationale

### Sponsorship Logic is Off-Chain
In CAP-0031, an alternative approach to sponsorship, the logic for determining
what can be sponsored is stored on the ledger. Not only is this complicated to
implement and reason about, but it also introduces a variety of limitations in
terms of what logic is supported. Moving sponsorship logic off-chain through
the "sandwich approach", analogous to what is done in CAP-0018, eliminates all
of these disadvantages.

### Why Should Sponsorship be Ephemeral?
There are a variety of reasons that sponsorship should be ephemeral. From a
practical perspective, it would be deeply unwise to delegate to another party
the right to make decisions about how your funds can be used to pay reserves. If
you were to do this, then the other party could drain your entire balance.

But the technical reasons are far more compelling. Ephemeral sponsorship
guarantees that both the sponsoring and sponsored accounts must sign any
transaction that establishes a sponsorship relation. This applies even in the
case of sponsorship for `CreateAccountOp`, whereas `CreateAccountOp` can
usually be used without a signature from the created account. As a consequence,
sponsorship introduces absolutely no backwards compatibility issues with regard
to pre-signed transactions or pre-authorized transactions.

Because every sponsorship requires agreement from the sponsoring and sponsored
accounts, it is safe to allow sponsorship revocation when the sponsored account
can afford the reserve itself. That is part of the contract of the sponsorship
relation, and if you didn't want revocation to occur then you shouldn't have
accepted the sponsorship in the first place.

### Example: Sponsoring Account Creation
In this example, we demonstrate how an account can be sponsored upon creation.
Let `S` be the sponsoring account, `C` be the creating account, and `A` the
newly created account (`S` and `C` may be the same account). Then the following
transaction achieves the desired goal:

```
sourceAccount: C
fee: <FEE>
seqNum: <SEQ_NUM>
timeBounds: <TIME_BOUNDS>
memo:
    type: MEMO_NONE
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: S
    body:
        type: MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP
        accountID: A
operations[1]:
    sourceAccount: C
    body:
        type: CREATE_ACCOUNT
        destination: A
        startingBalance: <STARTING_BALANCE>
operations[2]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP
        accountID: A
```

where `<FEE>`, `<SEQ_NUM>`, `<TIME_BOUNDS>`, and `<STARTING_BALANCE>` should all
be substituted appropriately. Note that this requires a signature from `A` even
though that account is being created.

### Example: Two Trust Lines with Different Sponsors
In this example, we demonstrate how a single account can create two trust lines
which are sponsored by different accounts in a single transaction. Let `S1` and
`S2` be the sponsoring accounts. Let `A` be the sponsored account. Then the
following transaction achieves the desired goal:

```
sourceAccount: A
fee: <FEE>
seqNum: <SEQ_NUM>
timeBounds: <TIME_BOUNDS>
memo:
    type: MEMO_NONE
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: S1
    body:
        type: MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP
        accountID: A
operations[1]:
    sourceAccount: C
    body:
        type: CHANGE_TRUST
        line: X
        limit: INT64_MAX
operations[2]:
    sourceAccount: S2
    body:
        type: MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP
        accountID: A
operations[3]:
    sourceAccount: C
    body:
        type: CHANGE_TRUST
        line: Y
        limit: INT64_MAX
operations[4]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: MANAGE_SPONSORSHIP
        accountID: A
```

where `<FEE>`, `<SEQ_NUM>`, and `<TIME_BOUNDS>` should all be substituted
appropriately.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All downstream systems will need updated XDR in order to recognize the new
operations and the modified ledger entries.

## Security Concerns
This proposal will slightly reduce the efficacy of base reserve changes, because
a sponsored ledger entries cannot cause an account to pass below the reserve
requirement.

## Test Cases
None yet.

## Implementation
None yet.
